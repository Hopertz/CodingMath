Vectors

A vector has magnitude (size) and direction:

Adding
We can add two vectors by joining them head-to-tail:
And it doesn't matter which order we add them, we get the same result:

Subtracting
We can also subtract one vector from another:

first we reverse the direction of the vector we want to subtract,
then add them as usual:

Adding Vectors
We can then add vectors by adding the x parts and adding the y parts:

Example: add the vectors a = (8, 13) and b = (26, 7)
c = a + b

c = (8, 13) + (26, 7) = (8+26, 13+7) = (34, 20)

Subtracting Vectors
To subtract, first reverse the vector we want to subtract, then add.

Example: subtract k = (4, 5) from v = (12, 2)
a = v + −k

a = (12, 2) + −(4, 5) = (12, 2) + (−4, −5) = (12−4, 2−5) = (8, −3)


Magnitude of a Vector
The magnitude of a vector is shown by two vertical bars on either side of the vector:

|a|

OR it can be written with double vertical bars (so as not to confuse it with absolute value):

||a||

We use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate it:

|a| = √( x2 + y2 )

Vector vs Scalar
A scalar has magnitude (size) only.

Scalar: just a number (like 7 or −0.32) ... definitely not a vector.

A vector has magnitude and direction, and is often written in bold, so we know it is not a scalar:

 -so c is a vector, it has magnitude and direction
 -but c is just a value, like 3 or 12.4


Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar
When we multiply a vector by a scalar it is called "scaling" a vector, because we change how big or small the vector is

(And now you know why numbers are called "scalars", because they "scale" the vector up or down.)
